CONCUR'15 Benchmarks
--------------------

Since the poet front-end is still experimental and does not 
accept the standard C language, for each benchmark there is 
a version for poet in the *poet* directory and another for 
nidhugg in the *nidhugg* directory.

Both directories contain bash scripts to reproduce the experiments.
If you are running poet on osx, due to a difference in the argcmd library
you should use the run_osx.sh script
